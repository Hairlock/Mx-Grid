# Moixa Demo

Split into modules for the api/ui/common elm data types

Api is in elm 0.18 

Ui is in elm 0.19

Not really how I would set something like this up but for the purposes of the demo it is what it is. If the dependencies install then run `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Little tensor flow app as well, basically from their demo page but with solar and demand data labels, with predictions on demand. `yarn tensor`
